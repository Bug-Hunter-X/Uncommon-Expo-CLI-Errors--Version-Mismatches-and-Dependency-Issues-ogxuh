This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the project's configuration.  It can manifest in various ways, often related to missing or outdated dependencies or incompatible SDK versions.  For instance, you might see errors during `expo start` or `expo build`. A common cause is using an older Expo CLI version with a newer project that uses features or dependencies not supported by that version. Another possibility is that the `package.json` file in your project has incorrect or conflicting dependencies, resulting in unmet peer dependencies or version mismatches. Incorrect configuration of EAS Build or other Expo services can also lead to this.
