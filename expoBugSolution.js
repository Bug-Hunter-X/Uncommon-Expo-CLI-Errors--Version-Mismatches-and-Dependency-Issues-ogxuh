The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI installed using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`. Always refer to the official Expo documentation for the recommended version.

2. **Verify Dependencies:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to examine the dependency tree and identify any missing, conflicting, or outdated packages.  Pay close attention to peer dependencies. Update or remove problematic packages as necessary. Resolve these conflicts by updating packages or using specific version ranges in package.json to address the unmet peer dependencies or version mismatches.

3. **Check SDK Version Compatibility:** The `package.json` file's `expo` SDK version should be compatible with the Expo CLI you are using and any installed dependencies. Consult Expo's documentation for compatibility guidelines.

4. **Inspect EAS Build Configuration (`eas.json`):** Carefully examine your `eas.json` file (if used) to verify all settings are correct and consistent with the project's requirements and any documentation provided by Expo. 

5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple `npm install` or `yarn install`, followed by a cache clearing and project rebuild, can address issues without significant code changes. If you're using yarn, you may need to run `yarn cache clean`.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the majority of unexpected Expo CLI errors associated with version mismatches and dependency problems.
