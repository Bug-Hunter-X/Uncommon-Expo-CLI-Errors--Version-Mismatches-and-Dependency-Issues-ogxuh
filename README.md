# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors: Version Mismatches and Dependency Issues

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked cause of Expo CLI errors: inconsistencies between the CLI version, project dependencies, and Expo SDK version.

## Problem
Expo CLI errors can arise from several subtle sources:

* **Version Mismatches:**  Using an outdated Expo CLI with a project requiring newer features.
* **Missing Dependencies:**  `package.json` might lack crucial dependencies or have incorrect version specifications.
* **Inconsistent SDK Versions:** The project's SDK version may not align with the CLI's expectations.
* **EAS Build Configuration Issues:**  Problems setting up or using Expo's EAS Build service.

## Reproduction
The `expoBug.js` file contains an example of a problematic project setup.  This simplified setup may not throw an error by default, and requires manual configuration to replicate the exact conditions of the error. It demonstrates the potential for errors depending on the CLI and package versions. 

## Solution
The `expoBugSolution.js` demonstrates how to correct the project setup and resolve the issues. It includes instructions on updating the Expo CLI, checking dependency versions using `npm ls` or `yarn why`, ensuring the project uses a compatible Expo SDK version, and verifying EAS Build configuration.

## Steps to Reproduce the Issue (Potential Scenarios):

1. **Outdated Expo CLI:** Install an older version of the Expo CLI, then try to run `expo start` on a project requiring a more recent version.
2. **Missing/Incorrect Dependencies:**  Manually edit `package.json` to remove or misspecify a crucial dependency (e.g., a `react-native` peer dependency).  Then run `expo start`. 
3. **SDK Version Mismatch:** Create a project with an older Expo SDK version. If you are trying to run features that require a later version, you will encounter an error.
4. **EAS Build Errors:** Inconsistent or incorrect settings in the `eas.json` file can lead to build errors. 

This repository aims to highlight the importance of maintaining consistent versions and meticulously reviewing project dependencies for a smoother Expo development workflow.
